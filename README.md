# MVVM Team Messenger

This was my school project in course ICS in VUT FIT. Fully working desktop messenger for teams with MVVM design pattern, C# WPF. Database was set up with EntityFrameworkCore as code first. It's not connected to remote SQL server, it uses SQL Server Express LocalDB. So you can either set up your local SQl server with EntityFramework Migrations or set up remote SQL server and replace database connection string in my code in database layer. User password is stored securely, but messages and others data is just plain text. A lot of things to improve. Credits for colors and final graphic design goes to Zhamilya Abikenova. 46/50b
